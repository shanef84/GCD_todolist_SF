Assignment 01: building a simple
todolist manager
introduction:

In this assignment you will be tasked with building your first useful Android application. This is going to be a simple todo list manager. It will be built around a custom adapter that will hook onto a list view that will show all tasks.

You application must be capable of adding tasks to the list and marking them complete and incomplete. It must also be capable of removing tasks from the list by the user long clicking on the task in question. You are not required however, to persist the task list in between application launches. For now you are working on building and working with a simple UI.

Each task will comprise two elements. A checkbox which determines if the task is complete and a piece of text that lists the name of the task. The task list is not required to be in any sorted order. A task is added whenever a user enters a piece of text representing the task name and clicks a button to create a new task. The new task item is then added to the list and is displayed to the user immediately
unchecked by default. A user can mark a task as complete or incomplete by changing the checkbox.

Finally a task can be removed by a user long clicking on the desired task.
